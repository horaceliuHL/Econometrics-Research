## An Analysis into Factors Which Determined Average SAT Scores in Public New York City High Schools

This was an econometrics research project conducted for an economics course at Stony Brook. The aim was to use multivariate linear and nonlinear regression, interactions, and instrumental variables to investigate whether certain factors such as population size, number of students in poverty, and number of students in English Language Learner programs affected each school's average SAT performance.

In order to conduct proper analysis, R was used to clean and investigate the data.
